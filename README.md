# `Mini_TicTacToe`

> _"A solved, futile, game (as a known problem solved) used to demonstrate the principles of front end web development and interactive web app design, development and deployment using version source control."_

## 1.0 Introduction

> <small><sup> Complete: ‚úÖ 24/01/22</sup></small>

***Tic Tac Toe*** origins can be traced back to its progenitor of three-in-a-row boards as fare back to ancient Egypt (since 1300 BC). Early variations of tic-tac-toe come from the Roman Empire (known as *terni lapilli/three pebbles at a time*). Another variation is [three man morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_men%27s_morris). For more on the [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#History).

Tic Tac Toe is a typical entry point for student developers to learning simple coding precepts and software development projects, hence it was chosen for this project. See the following goals in sections 1.1 Goals, 2.0 Solutions and 4.0 User Experience for goals and motivations. Additionally, it can get advanced with entry points into algorithm study via disciplines of Combinatorics and types of Artificial Intelligence algorithms; this is out of scope for the current project's goals and learning outcomes.

## 2.0 Solution: **`Tic Tac Toe`** - A Grid Game üöß‚úÖ

> Complete: ‚úÖ | Review: ‚ùì

### 2.1 Game Play ‚úÖ‚úÖ

- Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid <sup><b>(1)</b></sup>.
  - There is no universally agreed rule as to who plays first.
  - Convention is used so that **`X`** is played first.
- Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw as an optimal strategy. It is sometimes known as [futile game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futile_game) <sup><b>(2)</b></sup> in game theory.

**`Example GamePlay`: Wikipedia.com <sup><b>(1)</b></sup> **
![](refs/assets/img/Tic-tac-toe-game-1.png)

#### 2.1.1 This Game Play ‚úÖ‚úÖ

- When player starts a round, they click the start button.
- The First move is, by convention, signalled by the **`X`** first move.
- The 1st Player is marked by a `BLUE` marker, i.e. item or game token,
- The 2nd Player is automatically marked by a `RED` marker, i.e. item or game token.
- Players can only mark a turn/position once.
  - `Time Limits` is a potential feature (Credit: [Tic Tac Toe Web Browser Gameplay)](https://github.com/miloszmisiek/ci_p2_tictactoe#gameplay) <sup><b>(3)</b></sup>
    - Player has **time limit** for his move equals to **15 seconds**.
    - Timer starts when Player press **START/RESTART** button and is reset after every turn.
- To **win** the game, the first to mark 3 indices/rows in any direction, along one of these incidence structures.
  - 3 Horizontal Wins
  - 3 Vertical Wins
  - 2 Diagonal Wins
- To **draw** the game, is when no further win along the above indices/row and all spaces are occupied, or the next turn player concedes to a draw.
  `Winning Options: 3 indices in a row`
  ![](refs/assets/img/Three_Men's_Morris_variant_board.svg)
- Given that Tic Tac Toe is a futile game, Players may want to have a series a rounds of games
  - Each round is a sets
  - Best of `2n+1` sets is a match.
- Therefore, to score these rounds of games, scoring each will need to be tallied and kept.
  - **`Scoring`**: is a potential feature. Credit: [Tic Tac Toe Web Browser Gameplay)](https://github.com/miloszmisiek/ci_p2_tictactoe#gameplay) <sup><b>(3)</b></sup>
    - After every result, the respective score counter is updated for each player.
- To play a new game, Player can press **RESTART** button.
  - If a player wants to start over and have a new match: Players can press the **RESET MATCH**
- More on a Perfect Game strategies on Wikipedia **(1)**.

### 2.3 Developer Motivations ‚úÖ‚úÖ

- This is a second shot attempt at Code Institute's *JavaScript Essentials* assignment.
- Tic Tac Toe has a simple implementation and is commonly used to instruct student developers in:
  1. Fundamentals of *JavaScript* for interactive web design.
  2. Basics of Game Design as a common learning pattern for interactivity.
- This README is demonstration of the author's technical writing and structured documentation skills.
- A preference for technical choices that demonstrate a principle of **Locality of Behaviour**
  - **i.e.**: The behaviour of a unit of code should be as obvious as possible by looking only at that unit of code.
- The choice of *TailwindCSS*, as part of the requirements for the design and testing an interactive Front-End web application, is:
  - To build on the personal preference for pre-composed *CSS* styling and a opinionated library and or framework of styling.
  - Example of *Locality of Behaviour*.
  -

### 2.4 Future Features üöß

**For versions beyond version 2.0 / Alpha **

- `Time Limits` is a potential feature
- **`Scoring`**: is a potential feature.

### 2.5 Open Source Influences ‚úÖ‚úÖ

#### 2.5.1 Early Development: Upto Breaking Change and Bump to v2.0

Initially this project concept was to follow the author-developer, (myself), preferences for certain styles of programming and paradigms by using Tailwinds and AlpineJS.

This author-developer's project has a strong influence, code reuse, concept and implementation and bearing from [Scott Windon - Buy Him a Coffee]([Scott Windon | Linktree](https://linktr.ee/scottwindon "Buy Scot a Coffee").

- *CodePen*: [Scott Windon - AlpineJS Tic Tac Toe (codepen.io)](https://codepen.io/ScottWindon/pen/eYBMXQO "Scott Windon")
- *AlpineToolBox*: [Alpine Toolbox - Alpine.js Examples](https://www.alpinetoolbox.com/examples/)
  - Browsing for sources of implementation and showcase of AlpineJS projects.
  - Used for researching into the project and solution ideas.

**Why**: All Students reference former students previous code submissions and this is not an uncommon practice. Scott Windon's example is a good example of AlpineJS implementation, architecture and reference code. All Code will be commented and accredited as it is included into this solution and project.

**Shared Concepts**: Reused.

- Design: Font: Gochi-Hand
- JavaScript: AlpineJS in HTML and Game Code
- JavaScript: App Game Code

#### 2.5.2 Alpine Abandoned:

- **AlpineJS** as Javascript framework was abandoned (2024/01/15) in lieu of **NativeJS/ECMAScript v6**.
- The influneced of the AlpineJS Effect/Reactivity paradigm persisted howevever when handling asynchronous updates of JS Arrays (which are not reactive to updates) via the following design pattern:
  - Proxy Object in `watch.js` of the game's result object in the global scope.
  - Defining a Watcher behaviour using the Browser custom event handling
  - Updating the UI dynamically when certain end state conditions are met.
- While old code references to this initiator project may linger in history AND OLD COMMITS, they are not part of the final design and all prior commits and history is obsolete with the BREAKING CHANGE and reversion to NativeJS. THESE OLD CODE REFERENCES ARE NO LONGER CREDITS TO PRIOR ART.

## 3.0 User Experience ‚úÖ‚úÖ

> Complete: ‚ùì | Review: üìù | To Do: üìå

- While this project is not scoped for full-blown Agile processes, given the simplicity of the solution context; using concepts in simple application is appropriate to showcase.
  - **Personas**: Avatars for Types / Grouping of Users. For example: [From Personas to User Stories | Roman Pichler](https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/personas-epics-user-stories/), and useful for outline target audience groups.
  - **Feature** definition from : [Epics Features and Stories (gla.ac.uk)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/Media_730149_smxx.pdf).
  - **User Stories** from: [Epics Features and Stories (gla.ac.uk)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/Media_730149_smxx.pdf).

| First Time Players | People who never played a game of Tic Tac Toe                                    | Player           | First Timers |    |
| Returning Players  | People who want to repeat a game and keep score                                  | Player           | Returners    |    |
| Frequent Players   | People who want to improve their gaming experience, across multiple form factors | Player           | Frequents    |    |
| Dev Students       |                                                                                  | Student          | Developer    |    |

A gamer (role) can be one of three player types to form sub personas.

- i.e. Casual Gamers who are first time players.
- i.e. Casual Gamers who are returners players.
- i.e. Casual Gamers who are frequent players.
- i.e. Classic Gamer who are first time players.
- i.e. Classic Gamer who are returners players.
- i.e. Classic Gamer who are frequent players.

### 3.2 Features ‚úÖ‚õî

> In the context of Agile workflows: _A feature is a chunk of work from the Epic ‚Äì a deliverable that adds value and moves towards completing the Epic._

In this context, the author-developer extracts the definition of features and along with structuring semantics of a feature for definition purposes only so that:

- It provides a value to the user and reviewer alike.
- It should be estimable - with enough definition to provide an estimate of the effort involves.
- Be small enough to complete the feature for a milestone or version of work.
- Be (manually) testable - to be understandable what is to be tested to be passed and to be acceptable to the reviewer and the end user (if different).

Defining these features, within Milestones, (here), allows for alluding to the developer's Agile knowledge and for planning and design activities.

#### 3.5.2 Responsiveness ‚úÖ

> Users today are driven by experiences. Therefore, your web design must be responsive across all devices. With the increasing number of mobile users, one cannot emphasize the importance of responsive design in customer experience.

> **_What is a Breakpoint:_**
>
> - CSS Breakpoint is a ‚Äúdefined width‚Äù that is used in the webpage style to make the content and design responsive.
> - It helps enhance user experience by delivering consistent experience on different devices.

##### 3.5.2.1 [Common Breakpoints For Responsive Design (browserstack.com)](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/responsive-design-breakpoints#toc3) ‚úÖ

Assuming the default orientation is portrait for mobile and landscape for desktop.

- Mobile form factor tendency is to be in a portrait **P** orientation, as default.
- Tablet form factor tendency is to be in a portrait **P** or landscape **L** orientations, as default.
- Desktop form factor tendency is to be in a landscape **L** orientation, as default.

##### 3.5.2.2 [Best Practices for Adding Standard Responsive Breakpoints (browserstack.com)](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/responsive-design-breakpoints#toc6) ‚úÖ

- **Develop for Mobile Audience:** The developer and designer receive multiple benefits by developing and designing mobile-first content.
  - It is more difficult to simplify a desktop experience for mobile screens than expand a mobile view for desktop screens. When a design is mobile-first, developers address what is most necessary and can then make additions to match the preferences of desktop users.
  - Since mobile devices are more challenging to design due to smaller screens, developers and designers make tough choices initially. This saves them time later.
  - The load time of a page is much higher when one starts with CSS and smaller assets.
  - Developers and designers are compelled to consider functional differences occurring between different devices. For example, certain devices prioritize voice search, while others are more proficient with a keyboard or touchpad.
  - Less coding is involved since block-level elements such as a div, heading, or section expands to fill 100% of its parent by default. Thus, most content will fit a mobile screen automatically.
- **Reduce Friction:** A responsive design automatically reconfigures the elements on the page. It uses a single fluid layout that fits any screen size. But even with a responsive design in place, it is better to reduce friction by understanding and removing the unnecessary elements in the page.
  - Prioritise essential menu options.
  - Remove anything visually distracting.
  - Remove minor form fields.
  - Highlight the main CTA.
  - Focus on a robust search and filter function.
  - Always keep the common breakpoints for responsive design in mind. The former matches common screen sizes (480px, 768px, 1024px, and 1280px).
  - Before choosing major breakpoints, use website analytics to discern the most commonly used devices accessed by your site.
  - If they happen to be mobile devices, add mobile breakpoints for those screen sizes first.
- **Hide or Display Elements at Certain Breakpoints:** Switch content or features at common breaking points if necessary.
  - For example, consider implementing off-canvas navigation for smaller screens; and a typical navigation bar for larger ones.
- **Don‚Äôt Define Standard Responsive Breakpoints Based on the Device Size:** The primary objective of responsive design breakpoints is to display content in the best possible way.
  - So, let the content be the guide. Add a breakpoint when the content and design requires it.

#### 4.3.1 Fonts+ üöß

##### 4.3.1.1  Web Safe Fonts

- These font from Google where convert from `.ttf` to web safe variants i.e. `.WOFF`, `.WOFF2`
- Using then my URL handles these web safe versions as they are automatic unpacked by the Browser.
- While NOT used in the project per se, they are kep in repository for reference and design guidance purpose.
- Also for licence and Googele web URI fail-over/dependencies if there is a bug in web access or web performance issues, like the layout shift as fonts & page render.
- **`URL: Converter`**: https://transfonter.org/

> The @font-face CSS rule allows web developers to specify online fonts to display text on their web pages. By allowing authors to provide their own fonts, @font-face eliminates the need to depend on the limited number of fonts users have installed on their computers.

##### 4.3.1.3 Kanit ‚úÖ

- *Kanit* means mathematics in Thai, and the Kanit typeface family is a formal Loopless Thai and Sans Latin design.
- A notable detail is that the stroke terminals have flat angles, which allows the design to enjoy decreased spacing between letters while preserving readability and legibility at smaller point sizes.
- The *Kanit* project is led by *[Cadson Demak](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Cadson%20Demak)*, a type foundry in Thailand. To contribute, see [github.com/cadsondemak/kanit](http://github.com/cadsondemak/kanit)
- Chosen for:
  1. Suitability for responsiveness and scaling over smaller responsive form factors.
  2. Also has a strong design case for Title Fonts when stronger at 900 and light for lower scoring.
  3. For a personal style preference for Asian Typescript.
  4. And it compliments *Gochi-Hand* as simultaneous complementary pairing.

##### 4.3.1.4 Gochi-Hand ‚úÖ

- *Gochi Hand* is a typographic interpretation of the handwriting of a teenager.
  - The style is fresh, not like the letters made by a calligrapher, but those of an ordinary person.
  - The glyphs were carefully designed with a good curve quality, which makes it able to look good when printed too.
- *[Huerta Tipogr√°fica](http://huertatipografica.com/)* is a collaborative Argentinian type foundry with a deep respect for design and typography.
- Chosen for:
  1. To resemble hand-drawn, or handwriting, drawing of the tokens in a game of Tic Tac Toe.
  2. Code Reuse from *Scott Windon*, as this is the same font used in his open source code pen.
  3. And it compliments *Kanit* as simultaneous complementary pairing.
- Download: [Gochi-Hand - Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gochi+Hand "Designed by [Huerta Tipogr√°fica]")

## 6.0 Code ‚úÖ

> <small><sup> Complete: ‚úÖ 24/01/23</sup></small>

#### 6.0.1 Version Control ‚úÖ

##### 6.0.1.1 [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) ‚úÖ

> A changelog is a file, which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a
> project.

- All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
- To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each
  release (or version) of the project.
- People do. Whether consumers or developers, the end users of software are human beings who care about what's in the
  software. When the software changes, people want to know why and how.
- The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
  and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

- [X]  `Keep a ChangeLog`: _[`version 1.0.0`](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)_ - [Keep a ChangeLog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

##### 6.0.1.2 [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) ‚úÖ

> The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set
> of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This
> convention dovetails with [SemVer](http://semver.org/), by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

- [X]  `Conventional Commits`: _[`version 1.0.0`](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)_ - [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

##### 6.0.1.3 [SemVer Versioning](https://semver.org/))

> ‚ÄúSemantic Versioning.‚Äù Under this scheme, version numbers and the way they change convey meaning about the underlying
> code and what has been modified from one version to the next.

- Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
  - **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
  - **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
  - **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
    ‚úÖ

##### 6.0.1.4 Custom Descriptive Commits

- The author decided to merge and customize the two commit message standards to create a more descriptive commit message standard.
- There is a convention for not using commit messages as a changelog, but the author has decided to use the commit
  message as a keep a changelog, long with aspects of conventional commit messages and dovetailing with SemVer (as best manu effort as possible).
- See the following example for a custom descriptive commit message:
  - Why: The commit messages are used for assessment purposes in an academic context.
  - Thus, this makes it easier for assessors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each
    release (or version) of the project.
  - There is a loose adherence to the conventional commit message standard and SemVer.

#### 6.0.2 Code Structure ‚úÖ

###### 6.0.2.1 Design Patterns: Code Organisation ‚úÖ

- <ins>**Separation of Concerns v Locality of Behaviour**</ins>
  1. **Separation of Concerns**: HTML, CSS and JavaScript are kept in separate, linked files is a traditional approach to code factoring and project structure organization.
     - Related code is groups together in a single file by (mime-)type.
     - Allows for code re-use and centralized maintenance.
  2. **Locality of Behaviour**: The Locality of Behaviour principle states that the behaviour of code should be obvious
     on inspection. Or more formally: The behaviour of a unit of code should be as obvious as possible by looking only
     at that unit of code.
     - .
     - .

#### 6.0.3 Code Style ‚úÖ

**8.0.3.1 Style Guides**

- [X]  `HTML`: _[`HTML Style Guide`](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp)_ - [HTML Style Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp)
- [X]  `CSS`: _[`CSS Style Guide`](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp)_ - [CSS Style Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp)
- [X]  `JavaScript`: _[`JavaScript Style Guide`](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp)_ - [JavaScript Style Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp)

**8.0.3.2 Clean Code** ‚úÖ

- [X]  ‚úÖ `Clean Code Characteristics`: Project requirements for code quality and standards.
  - [X]  ‚úÖ Code demonstrates the characteristics of ‚Äòclean code‚Äô
    - all code is split into well-defined and commented sections
  - [X]  ‚úÖ File Naming Conventions
  - [X]  ‚úÖ HTML attributes, CSS rules, code variables and function:
    - names are consistent in the format.
    - follow standards for the language and are appropriate and meaningful
    - id/class(CSS and JavaScript)/function/variable names clearly indicate their purpose
    - The semantic markup is used to structure HTML code
  - [X]  ‚úÖ Class/Function/Variable Name Conventions: names are descriptive and consistent
  - [X]  ‚úÖ Cross-Platform Compatibility: names will not have spaces in them and will be lower-case only.
  - [X]  ‚úÖ Code is well-structured and easy to read.
- [X]  ‚úÖ `Code Readability and Maintainability`:
  - [X]  ‚úÖ Code is indented in a consistent manner to ease readability
  - [X]  ‚úÖ Code has no unnecessary repeated blank lines (and never more than 2)
- [X]  ‚úÖ `Code Formating`: The Clean Code Characteristic enforced by and (actions on save):
  - JetBrains IDE Code Style
  - Editorconfig: IDE / Per Language
  - Prettier: on each commit, via JB commit actions, and on save.
  - ESLint for JavaScript
  - Stylelint
- [X]  ‚úÖ `Code Linting`: The Clean Code Characteristic enforced by:
  - JetBrains IDE Code Style &amp; Code Inspections
  - HTMLHint
  - Stylelint
  - StandardJS for JavaScript
  - ESLint for JavaScript

#### 6.0.4 Project Structure ‚úÖ

- [X]  ‚úÖ  `Project Templates`: GitHub allows for each repository to be used as templates for new projects.
  - `Directory Structure` is defined in the repository template.
  - `Issue & Pull Request Templates` are defined in the repository template in the `.github` directory.
  - `File Structure` is defined in the repository template.
    - `Grouping by File Types`: e.g. assets directory will group related file types via subdirectories.
    - `Grouping by Libraries & Frameworks`: e.g. `node_modules` directory will group related file types via subdirectories. Though `node_modules` are not always pushed the remote repository.
    - `Grouping by Features`: e.g. `components` directory will group related file types via subdirectories.

    - The actual reference on Cascading Style Sheets are the [CSS Specifications](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/#specs).
  - This tool is largely out of date, and documentation on their [About the W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/about.html) has references to 2.1.
    - Useful for learning purposes, however there are features in *ModernCSS* (*InterOp 2023*, between browser vendors) that are seen as errors in *W3C JigSaw*.

## 7.0 Logic & Code Flow ‚úÖ

> <small><sup> Complete: ‚úÖ 24/01/23</sup></small>

#### 7.1 Mermaid: Code Flow: ``Logic.JS: GameLogic Class``

> What follows is a series of Mermaid Flowchart of the game logic class tracking the method calls, and key returns objects.
> The class GameLogic acts as like a server / backend to the Game of Tic Tac Toe.

**Question: Why This Design**

> 1. Could a simpler design be used, most definitely.
> 2. Dies ot my 20 year old bias for OOP and class based design, I fall into a cognitive/design bias for OOP and Classes based on my prior knowledge of Java, C# and other back end technologies.
> 3. However, after man-hours of effort, I was committed to this design.
> 4. In future versions, would I choose this approach. No
> 5. Does it showcase my skills and coding techniques, Yes.
> 6. I get to play with Mermaid as a text to diagram documentation skill.

##### Select Cell, Click & Move Validity

```mermaid

## 10.0 Deployment ‚úÖ‚úÖ

> <small><sup> Complete: ‚úÖ 24/01/22</sup></small>

### 10.1 Deployment Strategy ‚úÖ

- Develop on `*/branch-name-vN.M` trunk (1Ô∏è‚É£)
- Pull Request and Merge into the `main` branch (2Ô∏è‚É£)
- Pull Request from `main` into the `deploy/mini_tictactoe` branch (3Ô∏è‚É£)

Notes on the above:

- 1Ô∏è‚É£: Strategy is to develop on long-lived development trunks on a per technology/design approach. Naming goes as follows:
  - a: Folder: Intent (i.e. before the `/`)
  - b: Branch Name: Identifier / Module Name (i.e. after the `/`)
- 2Ô∏è‚É£: PR into `MAIN` branch act as a final code review/quality gate (if configured for SonarLint CI and other code review/code quality tools). This is keep light weight for now.
- 3Ô∏è‚É£: Working and Code Review Code is then deployed into long-lived (maybe in future, per each major version) branches to which GitHub.io Pages environments are configured. This is keep light weight for now.

```
Regular pushes to trunk branches, and then pull into to main and finally to deploy/* branches.
```

### 10.2 Deployment Configuration ‚úÖ

- Source: Deploy from Branch: `deploy/mini_tictactoe`
- Root: `./` or root üìÇ
- SRC:  `./src/assets/*` or src üìÇ for *css/js/fonts/img*
